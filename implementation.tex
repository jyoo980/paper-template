\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

\todo{Any paper about a new tool should include a short ``implementation'' section like this one.
  The key things to explain are: 1) what language the tool targets, 2) any important libraries that
  the tool relies on (\eg the Checker Framework), and 3) that the tool is open-source.}
